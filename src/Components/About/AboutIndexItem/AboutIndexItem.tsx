Picture this: a high school kid jamming on guitar, but fate had other plans. When the call for a bassist arose to form a band, Rick answered without hesitation, and the rest is history! For a solid decade, he laid down the foundation, slapping those bass strings like a seasoned pro. But life had its twists and turns. Rick put his bass aside to focus on raising his kids. Fast forward 25 years, and a revelation struck: music isn't just notes; it's a safeguard against forgetting who we are. Rick dusted off his guitar, rekindling his love affair with music. Yet, something was missing. Four years later, a thunderous epiphany hit him: he wasn't just any musician; he was a BASS PLAYER. Influenced by legends like Flea, Luis Johnson, John Entwistle, and Duff McKagan, Rick's bass lines groove like thunderstorms, electrifying every stage he graces. But here's the kicker: Rick's not just about playing. He's about living, breathing, and exuding music! Witness the magic unfold as he takes center stage, electrifying crowds with his infectious energy and killer bass licks. Because for Rick, the thrill of live performance isn't just a momentâ€”it's a way of life. Catch Rick Gentry in action, and prepare to be swept away on a sonic adventure you won't soon forget! ðŸŽ¶âœ¨",
